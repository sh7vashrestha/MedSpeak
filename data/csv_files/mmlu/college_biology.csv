MMLU,college_biology,mmlu::college_biology::5,"One hypothesis posed by evolutionary biologists to account for an organism's altruistic behavior in social groups is that of kin selection. According to the kin selection theory, the risk incurred by a bird that sounds an alarm call due to a nearby predator may be offset by the fact that",the alarm call induces the predator to abandon its hunt,the alarm call allows the bird to gain protection at the center of a flock,the alarm call will benefit those members with whom the bird shares a percentage of its genes,the bird will gain the same early warning advantage from another member of the flock at a future time,C,"One hypothesis posed by evolutionary biologists to account for an organism's altruistic behavior in social groups is that of kin selection.
